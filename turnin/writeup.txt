The website functions to let viewers search for an NBA player with the CSV data pushed to the RDS. It includes a very simple layout with a search bar and a background image. From there, the user is taken to the player.php page, where if they had given the name of player, it will display the image of the player as well as given data about them. The search bar on index.php is dynamic, albeit a bit slow. In this manner, it makes it much easier for the user to know who they are searching for, and does not require them to be precise so long as they know the general name of the player (ex. James, instead of LeBron James). PHP code are all within functions, and are not separate. The only large chunk is found in player.php, in which multiple scenarios need to be accounted for. OOP was practiced as much as possible, though it is highly likely there are some forms of redundancy. This is alleviated to an extent with repeating code placed into a function (button()). The pyr.php refers to the Player class, which is used to call the information from the database rather than directly on the player.php page. There is also javascript involved, but that is part of the extra credit to create a dynamic search. 
Overall, there were a lot of small bumps in the road, but nothing really that made it exceedingly difficult. The hardest part was getting the server up and running; alot of that was completely out of my expertise, and made it hard to find workarounds for problems that weren't mentioned in the discussion board. The code was relatively straightforward, and was not too difficult to implement.
